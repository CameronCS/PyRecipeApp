# The Python Recipe App
This is a recipe app I did in C# but am doing in python for farther education purposes


# Breakdown
This app consists of 2 parts

A `Client App` in the *Main.py* file

A `Server App` in the *Server.py* file

# The Client
The Client App will be a basic Front End App which the user will interact with

# The Server
The server will host the database and the Back end Functionality of the App

# How to Run
The Repository Comes with 2 `.bat` files as this was designed on Windows Device

To run the each app you can run each of the batch scripts

If you are `Visual Studio Code` I would Reccomend running the Script needed to be debugged through `VSC`
and than other side with the batch scripts.

*Note!!* The batch scripts imply that Python is installed and set up as an Environment Variable

## The 2 Client Scripts
There are 2 Batch Scripts in the repo.

`RunClientD` is a debug version run with *py* so the terminal will appear

`RunClientR` is a "release" version run with *pyw* thus the terminal does not appear
